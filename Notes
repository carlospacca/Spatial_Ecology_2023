# Lecture 3
We are goingo to talk about populations, so individuals from the same species.
Drosophila suzukii is replacing Drosophila melanogaster because the first one is more tollerant to high temperatures ranges.

## Density
Is the numbero of individuals per unit area or volume.

## Dispersion
Is how the individuals are located in the area/volume, can be Clumped aggregated in patches maybe for food or mating, 
Uniform maybe for terriorial reasons, Randomic with no type of interactions.

### Population dynamics
Births and Immigration (new ingress of individuals), Death and Emigration (Loss of individuals).

## Survivorship Curves
Humans make few child (1-2) but they are going to survive surely during their first stages of life, 
Mammals in general have a medium line of survivor, other vertebrates start in critical condition of 
survival but they stabilize during time.

## Zero population growth 
It occurs when the death rate is equal to the birth rate, until there are resources a population can grow
exponentially with no limits, but reality it's not like this, we will arrive to an asindote called K, and above this limit, you can't grow
without some death due to competition for resouces, this is called logistic growth. The line will stabilize with the K asindote. K is equal to the maximum
number of individuals which the enviroment can afford without triggering competitions due to the end of resources.

### r-species
Species based on reproduction, their goal is to reproduct as much as they can.

### K-species
Is not based on reproduction, instead they establish their strategy in survival. 

## Metapopulation
Are groups of populations linked by immigration and emigration; Humans are a Metapopulation, the enviroment can support at maximum 10-15 billion of humans

## Ecological footprint
Is how much we are impacting the whole wnviroment with food, space, nonrenewable resources or buildup of wastes
